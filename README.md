# Mobile Plan Revenue Analysis
The dataset belongs to the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

# Goal
The purpose of the project is to provide conclusive data determining which prepaid plan, Surf or Ultimate, brings in more revenue. We are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection by analyzing clients' behavior and details: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages sent.

# Hypothesis Testing
- The average revenue from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs
- The average revenue from users in the New York - New Jersey area is different from that of the users from other regions
